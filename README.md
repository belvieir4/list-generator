# Listin - the image list generator

This a personal project that originated from my collector hobby.

As a person that loves collectables and action figures, I used had some images or lists from the items I had on my wishlist, but it was a little troublesome to deal with all those files, especially when I had to share with friends. So i've built this image list generator where the user can add all images from the items they want, with or without a name for that item, and generate a single image listing everything.

**This is an example of image generated with it:**

You can use it for other purposes too, like building a visual list of groceries so you can avoid buying the wrong brand of something. ðŸ¤£
